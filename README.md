These are my personal Macbook Pro (Ansible) setup scripts mostly copied from Bas Meijer:

The dotfiles section is mostly copied from Lars Kappert:
https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles

You can use this on a Mac to automatically install free software using
one command. Having a high degree of automation in the OSX setup is awesome!

# Step 1: Clone this repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/scorputty/infra_mac.git
```

# Step 2: Edit the files to your preference
### dotfiles
As an absolute minimum you need to edit the dotfiles/git/.gitconfig.
```json
[user]
  name = Firstname Lastname
  email = your email
```
And you might want to change your computer name in file osxsettings.sh to something that makes sense to you.
```sh
COMPUTER_NAME="hipstermacbookname"
```

### packages and system settings
You can add more apps & packages in vars/main.yml.
### Currently auto-installed apps:
```yaml
  - ansible
  - atom
  - autoconf
  - automake
  - flash-player
  - google-chrome
  - iterm2
  - java
  - packer
  - pycharm-ce
  - python
  - sqlite
  - ssh-copy-id
  - telegram
  - terraform
  - torbrowser
  - vagrant
  - virtualbox
  - vlc
  - wget
```
### OSX system settings
Review or / and edit osxsettings.sh to your preference.

# Step 3: Run
```sh
./install_on_my_mac.sh
```

### WARNING The scrips may set DNS and proxies and user defaults.

This is work in progress... Ruby GEMS don't update very good, looking in to that.
