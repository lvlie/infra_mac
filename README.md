These are my personal Macbook Pro setup scripts mostly copied from Bas Meijer:
https://github.com/bbaassssiiee/developer_mac

You can use this on a Mac to automatically install free software using
one command. Having a high degree of automation in the OSX setup of our
developers proved to be great for new joiners, they are productive in
less than an hour.
 
### WARNING The scrips set DNS and proxies and user defaults.
 
You can add more apps & packages, or uncomment the suggested set,
in vars/main.yml.
